# CS194: Special Topics - Decentralized Finance (Fall 2024, UCB)

This repository contains coursework from **CS194: Special Topics in Decentralized Finance**, which I took in Fall 2024 at UC Berkeley. The course explores the principles and applications of decentralized finance (DeFi), including blockchain technologies, smart contracts, and financial decentralization.

## Contents:

- **Labs**: Hands-on assignments focused on implementing and analyzing DeFi protocols, blockchain technologies, and smart contracts.

## Key Concepts Covered:

- **Blockchain Technology**: Fundamentals of decentralized systems, consensus mechanisms, and distributed ledger architecture.
- **Smart Contracts**: Writing and deploying secure smart contracts using Ethereum and Solidity.
- **DeFi Protocols**: Exploring decentralized exchanges (DEXs), automated market makers (AMMs), and lending protocols.
- **Cryptographic Security**: Ensuring security through cryptographic methods, including digital signatures and hash functions.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Understanding the role of DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) in managing decentralized systems.
- **Regulatory and Security Risks**: Addressing legal, financial, and security challenges in decentralized finance.

## How to Navigate:

- **Labs**: All lab assignments are located under the `Lab/` directory. These assignments focus on practical applications of DeFi concepts, including blockchain development and smart contract deployment.


Explore the coursework to see how decentralized financial systems are designed, implemented, and analyzed using blockchain technology and cryptographic principles. This repository showcases my practical and theoretical understanding of decentralized finance and its transformative potential in modern financial systems.
